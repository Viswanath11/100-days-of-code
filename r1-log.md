### R1D7 - 4.1.2018
I know, i know, the road travels way off goals. But I think we need to make few things clear here. The point in accepting this challenge is to not set my goals far too high to reach and do nothing and eventually quit but, i'm here to see work getting done some how in mids of all the pressure from both home and changes at workspace. So, let's do our best, try to put in the effort every day if possible and leae the rest. No point in thinking about the days gone unworked.
